      Hi there, I'm a student at Unviersity of Michigan.<br/>
      <br/>
      My major is <i>computer science</i>.<br/>
      I want to be a software developer when I graduate.<br/>
      I'm interested in web development and I'm striving to become
      a full stack developer.<br/>
      <br/>
      I enjoy programming very much and I tried to build some small games in my spare time.
      Feel free to check out some of the games I built by clicking on the links located on the 
      navigation bar.<br/>
      <br/>
      I like programming languages very much. I'm familiar with C, C++
      , python, R, javascript, ruby, bash script, scheme, emacs-lisp. 
      To me, learning a new language is like collecting a gem. 
      Every language is valuable as they attack different tasks 
      at different angles (although every language is turing complete,
      languages significantly affect efficiency for programmers). 
      By far My favorite language is python as 
      it is consise, extremely readable, explicit in its intention 
      instead of relying too much on convention. Although it may not 
      be fast enough for certain applications, it has a simple
      interface with C that makes writing fast code possible.
      I also like the fact that python is a multi-paradigm 
      programming language. Functional programming and
      object oriented programming are both feasible, which is really 
      handy. Anyway, dynamically typed language will certainly win 
      over statically typed language.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I'm currently doing a research on <i>Computer Vision</i>.
      You may want to checkout this link to read about it.</br>

      Besides computer science, I'm taking many statistics and 
      math classes. Statistics is important in order to "understand" 
      big data. It offers insight into the distribution the data 
      come from and based on that predictions can be made. I'll post 
      more content on statistics on this site in the future.
      <br/><br/>
      I like to read books and would like to build a social network 
      site to encourage reading books. I'm starting a project 
      called <i>legitur</i>. It's on github and currenly I'm the only 
      contributor.
